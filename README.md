Just a collection of interesting lines I've collected from things I've read.

### Metadata spec

Each top level directory is for an author, and contains a meta.yml file:

```
author: Name of Author
books:
  file_path_of_book: Name of Book
```

This is primarily to allow the file names to be polite (no spaces, alphanumeric + underscores) and still retain accurate author/book names.
