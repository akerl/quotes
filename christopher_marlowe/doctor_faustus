If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us. Why, then belike, we must sin, and so consequently die.
My blood congeals and I can write no more.
What will not I do to obtain his soul!
Where we are is hell, and where hell is there must we ever be.
Yet in a minute had my spirit returned, and I had breathed a man made free from harm.
Be silent then, for danger is in words.
His faith is great, I cannot touch his soul.
