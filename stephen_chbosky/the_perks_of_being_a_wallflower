And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.
To tell you the truth, I think I made them all nervous.
And I felt very bad for both of them.
It would be very nice to have a friend again. I would like that even more than a date.
The thing is that some girls think they can actually change guys.
And I wonder if anyone is really happy. I hope they are.
Sometimes people use thought to not participate in life.
We accept the love we think we deserve.
He didn't know and would never ask and didn't think it mattered.
You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.
And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.
I just listened to the music, and breathed in the day, and remembered things.
I am really in love with her, and it hurts very much.
I don't know the significance of this, but I find it very interesting.
I am very interested and fascinated by how everybody loves each other, but no one really likes each other.
They just knew. And I think that's all you can ever ask from a friend.
There was no pain. There was no pain anymore.
And I never wanted to. You have to believe me.
Maybe this is the way things are supposed to be, but it doesn't feel right.
People who try to control situations all the time are afraid that if they don't, nothing will work out the way they want.
Something really is wrong with me. And I don't know what it is.
Things change. And friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody.
There was always some excuse. He called them "reasons."
I realized at that moment that I really did love her. Because there was nothing to gain, and that didn't matter.
I guess we all forget sometimes. And I think everyone is special in their own way. I really do.
I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there.
