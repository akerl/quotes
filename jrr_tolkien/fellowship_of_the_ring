I think I need a holiday.
I don't know half of you half as well as I should like, and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
This is the end. I am going. I am leaving now. Goodbye!
I don't expect I shall return. In fact, I mean not to.

Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment.

I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again.

The choice is yours: to go or to wait.
Advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all courses may run ill.
I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.
All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost.
You were beginning to fade.
We are sitting in a fortress. Outside it is getting dark.
The time of my thought is my own to spend.
It is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain.
He that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom.
And he lived happily ever afterwards to the end of his days.
But which it is that he sees, even the wisest cannot always tell. Do you wish to look?
Seeing is both good and perilous.
May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out.
