The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow, and he was pierced by many.
For I am also a stewart. Did you not know?
I fear a cage. To stay behind bars, until use and old age accept them, and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire.
Let us remember that a traitor may betray himself and do good that he did not intend.
Then farewell! But if I should return, think better of me!
Walk no more in the shadows, but awake!
They were not forgotten. But they were far beyond aid.
I have come. But I do not choose now to do what I came to do. I will not do this deed.
There are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured.
It is gone forever, and now all is dark and empty.
I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.
