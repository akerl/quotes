Life goes on, despite the gathering dark.
In the end, what we are is: alone.
You burn so brightly now, I would hate to put you out.
For now, you might disagree, but you dare not disobey.
How casually we betray our creatures.
In real life, it is often dark.
I'm not ready to give up yet. Doesn't hurt enough.
How glad will we be that we let her dream live, when the dreamer is dead.
Unarmed fights always went to ground in the end.
Ornamentation is not logically a high priority.
My death is someone else's responsibility.
Loved more than you, have I. Lost more. Hated more. Killed more.
When you fall, catch you I will.
Want something else. Want power. Want wealth. Want to be safe. Want to be free from fear!
Choose, and start again!
